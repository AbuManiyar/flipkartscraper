As per flipkart policy I cant return the product again because of this.  I am going to dispose the item. I am not worrying about money but the response and service from flipkart is weird. Sorry for that.
364,"Hit Rechargeable Anti - Mosquito Racquet Electric Insect Killer Indoor, Outdoor (Bat)",arun adithya,NA,Don't waste your money,"In initial 15 to 20 days it works well but after that no mosquito has been hitted ....after that 7 days period I had no option to replace my product ,even in this 15 days I never handle the bat roughly ,so kindly don't buy it .....I am not against this product or sponser of other but I am one of the victims of this product"
365,"Hit Rechargeable Anti - Mosquito Racquet Electric Insect Killer Indoor, Outdoor (Bat)",Rakesh Nama,NA,Could be way better,"For fast few days it works well and makes a sound when a mosquito is hit by it, but after a week it stops making a sound. Not recommended."
366,"Hit Rechargeable Anti - Mosquito Racquet Electric Insect Killer Indoor, Outdoor (Bat)",sonu chourasia,NA,Terrific,"Product is very good, build quality is good, wire mesh is also working properly.It  has a blue light which is not equivalent to the usual LED light but rather it is meant for attracting mosquitoes. I got it for Rs 480. I have used it for 7 days and I have not charged it twice, only  the first day I have charged.So it's better not to buy China product which cost you Rs 150 to 200, rather buy this, it is equivalent to 3-4 Chinese rackets.Like, if this review helped you. :-)"

Based on my experience, i decided to write this review. This product is NOT going to make you fair and it doesn't do skin whitening BUT what it does is it removes black spots and random marks on your skin. After ~6 months of usage, my face looks like its been beautified by an oppo phone. The skin feels nice and there are no visible marks or black color spots. My entire face has the same color shade.  Buy this if you have black / white spots or ..."
